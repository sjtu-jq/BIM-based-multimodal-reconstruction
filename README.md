# BIM-based 3D Multimodal Reconstruction for Substation Equipment Inspection Images

## About Me
This is the source code for image decision strategy and image harmonization method, which are two necessary steps in the process of BIM-based 3D multimodal reconstruction for substation equipment inspection images. This multimodal reconstruction method is proposed in my manuscript submitted to **IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement** with status **Accepted**. More implementation details is coming soon...

## Source Model Data
You can download the BIM model and related virtual and realworld multimodal images at my google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cCyplXP6wprHzeSY_mECKxErdZ11051D/view?usp=drive_link).

## Implementation
Coming sooooooooooooooooooon...Sorry for the indefinite delay, because I have already graduated and worked in a company :(

## Contributions
Contributions (bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, etc.) are very welcome and should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.
